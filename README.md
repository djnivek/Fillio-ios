Fill.io Framework [iOS Side]
This is the server side of Fill.io Framework based on an MVC architecture and PHP 5.4+

## WT# is Fill.io ?

This is a wonderful framework based on multiple languages. It provides a fully backend solution for your applications.

Our goal it's to simplify the process between the server and your application, whatever plateform it is (iOS / Android ...)<br>
We wanna symplify data management, processes like In App Purchase, iOS Notifications etc...

We would like to eliminate writing code on the server side.

You'll add features just by donwloading and installing them on the backend provided [__coming soon__]
